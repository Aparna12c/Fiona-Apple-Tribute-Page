                            Fiona Apple McAfee Maggart (born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter,
                            pianist
                            and record producer.
                            Classically trained on piano as a child, Apple began composing her own songs when she was
                            eight
                            years old. Her debut
                            album, Tidal, written when Apple was seventeen, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy
                            Award
                            for Best Female Rock
                            Vocal Performance for the single "Criminal". She followed with When the Pawn... (1999),
                            produced
                            by Jon Brion, which was
                            also critically and commercially successful and went certified platinum.
                        </p>



                        <p>
                            For her third album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and
                            began recording the album in
                            2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the
                            record, leading fans to
                            erroneously protest Epic Records, believing that the label was withholding its release. The
                            album was eventually
                            re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005 to critical acclaim. She released her
                            fourth studio album, The
                            Idler Wheel..., in 2012, which was followed by an extensive tour of the USA. The album
                            received
                            universal praise.
